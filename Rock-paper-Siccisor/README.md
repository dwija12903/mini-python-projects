# 🪨📜✂️ Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

This is a fun **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game built using Python's **Tkinter** library for the graphical user interface (GUI). You play against a randomly chosen opponent (a friend), and the game continues until either you or your opponent reaches 5 points.

## 🌟 Features

- User-friendly GUI built with **Tkinter**.
- Play against randomly chosen opponents from a predefined list.
- Live score tracking.
- Game ends when either player reaches 5 points.
- Visual buttons for Rock 🪨, Paper 📜, and Scissors ✂️ choices.

## 🚀 How to Run the Game

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/rock-paper-scissors-game.git
   cd rock-paper-scissors-game
   ```

2. Ensure you have **Python** installed. You can install Tkinter if needed:
   ```bash
   pip install tk
   ```

3. Run the `rock_paper_scissors.py` file:
   ```bash
   python rock_paper_scissors.py
   ```

## 🎮 How to Play

1. The game selects a random opponent from a list of friends (e.g., Dwija, Krishiv, Sneha, etc.).
2. You can choose between **Rock 🪨**, **Paper 📜**, or **Scissors ✂️** by clicking the respective buttons.
3. The game will display the opponent's choice and the result (win, lose, or tie).
4. The first player to reach 5 points wins the game, and a message box will pop up declaring the winner.

## 🛠️ Project Structure

- `rock_paper_scissors.py`: The main Python script that runs the game logic and GUI.
- The game uses a Tkinter window to display buttons and update the score and result labels.

## 💡 Game Logic

- **Rock 🪨** beats **Scissors ✂️**
- **Scissors ✂️** beats **Paper 📜**
- **Paper 📜** beats **Rock 🪨**
- The game will declare a winner or loser based on who reaches 5 points first.

## 🎉 Example

- **You** chose Rock 🪨.
- **Opponent** (e.g., Dwija) chose Scissors ✂️.
- **Result**: You won! 🎉

```
