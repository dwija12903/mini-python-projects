# Tic Tac Toe Using MinMax Algorithm üéÆ
## The Tic-Tac-Toe game with an AI opponent using the Minimax algorithm for decision-making.

### üíª Features:
- Play Tic-Tac-Toe against an AI opponent.
- AI opponent uses the Minimax algorithm to make optimal moves.
- Interactive command-line interface for playing the game.

### ‚è≥ Advantages and Disadvantages:
- Advantages:
    1. Completeness: Finds a solution if it exists given a finite search space.
    2. Optimality: Provides optimal solutions assuming both players play optimally.
    3. Exhaustive Assessment: Evaluates all possible moves, ensuring thorough analysis.
- Disadvantages:
    1. High Time and Space Complexity: Due to the exhaustive search of all possible moves.
    2. Large Branching Factor: Slows down the algorithm, especially with deep trees.
    3. Performance and Efficiency: Hindered by the evaluation of all possible subspaces.

### üåü Improvements over Minimax:
- Alpha-Beta Pruning: Advanced version of Minimax that prunes branches to reduce complexity.
